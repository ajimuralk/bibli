# bibli
[Personal Project] [WIP] - A location-based social network that broadcasts what nearby users are current reading.

## About

Bibli allows users to share information about their current book/audiobook, and displays what others are reading within a 200m radius. This allows users to learn about new books and make new connections in one's community based on common literary interests.

Bibli is built with React, React-Bootstrap, Express, Node.js, MySQL, and Sequelize.

## Project Status

The following features are in progress: 
- Users are able add events/open book clubs to the Event tab
- Users can designate titles under "Currently Reading," "Loved," and "Want to Read"
- Push notification availablity when users are in 200m of one another and share a title in either of the above categories
- Implement Socket.io for chat feature between nearby users
